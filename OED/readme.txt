The MATLAB code files in this folder implement the methods for computation of quadrature points for the multivariate equivalent of Gaussian quadrature and the computation of results that are described in the paper "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions". Other code files are provided for further examples.

The code files provide the results for the aforementioned paper and further examples, as follows:
- The code file quadrature_norm.m provides the computation of quadrature points in Section 7.1 of the paper "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions", namely the quadrature points for a normal distribution shown in Fig. 1. The code file quadrature_beta.m provides the computation of quadrature points in Section 7.2 of the paper "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions", namely the quadrature points for a beta distribution shown in Fig. 3. The code files quadrature_unif.m and quadrature_gam.m can be used to obtain similar results for a uniform distribution and a gamma distribution, respectively.
- The code file plot_solution.m provides the results for the Lotka-Volterra system in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the paper "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions", namely Fig. 2 by selecting [1,-2,-1] as the arc sequence and the options n, f, n and Fig. 4 by selecting [1,-2,-1] as the arc sequence and the options b, f, y.

The computation of quadrature points for the multivariate equivalent of Gaussian quadrature is implemented with the help of the auxiliary MATLAB code files quadrature.m, quad_obj.m, and basis.c. The computation of results for the Lotka-Volterra system is implemented with the help of the auxiliary MATLAB code files arc_eval.m, lveq.m, and variance_y.m.
