# SNSF project P2ELP2_184521

Code developed in Prof. Ali Mesbah's group at UC Berkeley for the Swiss National Science Foundation project P2ELP2_184521. This code is related to the papers "Multivariable Control Based on Incomplete Models via Feedback Linearization and Continuous-Time Derivative Estimation", "Efficient and Adaptive Global Solutions to Single-Input Optimal Control Problems via Polynomial Optimization and Gaussian Processes", "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions", and "Optimal Control of Dose Delivery in Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets".

Check the folders Controller, OED, and Optimal control for readme files with more information.
