# SNSF project P2ELP2_184521

Code developed in Prof. Ali Mesbah's lab at UC Berkeley for the Swiss National Science Foundation project P2ELP2_184521. This code is related to the papers "Multivariable Control Based on Incomplete Models via Feedback Linearization and Continuous-Time Derivative Estimation", "Efficient Global Solutions to Single-Input Optimal Control Problems via Approximation by Sum-of-Squares Polynomials", "Tractable Global Solutions to Chance-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design for Arbitrary Prior and Noise Distributions", and "Data-driven Adaptive Optimal Control under Model Uncertainty for Cold Atmospheric Plasmas".

Check the folders Controller, OED, and Optimal control for readme files with more information.
